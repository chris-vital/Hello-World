# Hello-World
First Repositiry
The goal here is to Learn github basics 


My name is Chris. I first learned to program in high school with visual basic, c++, and a little javascript.
I loved it almost immediatelty. Unfortuneately I'm the type of person who is always affraid of failure. I didn't think i was smart
enough to pursue it in college so i didn't. Long story short I left college and went into the work force. Many years have gone by since then and now I'm a truck driver, and have been one since November 2018. After 2 months alone for 5 days out of the week with extra time on my hands and I mean nothing but time i started listnening to audio tracks on different subjects. One day I happen to listen to a computer science lecture and BAM....I was hooked again. After 2 weeks of just listeng to information about data science, web development, game development, and machine learning i redownloaded Visual Studio and made a guess the random number game. I realised after the first 5 lines I wanted to do this everyday. I researched about job oppertunities and to my suprise getting a software developer job without a degree is a do-able goal. So I went to codecademy, udemy, and youtube and am learning to code almost every day. 
Im havent been this excited about anything in a long time.
